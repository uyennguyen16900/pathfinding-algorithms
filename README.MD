# Pathfinding

Pathfinding seeks to find the shortest path between 2 given nodes in a 2D grid using Depth-first search, Breadth-first Search, [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#Algorithm), and [A\* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).

### Built with:

- [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)
